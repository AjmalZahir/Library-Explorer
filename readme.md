# Library Explorer

Library Explorer is a web application that helps users locate libraries in Bristol using open data from the [Bristol Open Data](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/). The dataset contains details about public libraries, including their names, addresses, opening hours, available facilities, and contact information. The project aims to provide an intuitive interface for users to search and explore libraries based on location and services offered.
