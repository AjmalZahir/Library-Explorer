# Requirements

## User Needs

### User Stories

- As a **user**, I want to **search for a library by name, street, town, or postcode**, so that I can quickly find the library I am looking for.
- As a **user**, I want to **sort the library list by name, town, or distance**, so that I can easily organize the information based on my preference.
- As a **user**, I want to **find the nearest library based on my current location**, so that I can visit the closest one conveniently.
- As a **user**, I want to **view a libraryâ€™s location on a map**, so that I can get directions and understand its surroundings.
- As a **user**, I want to **filter libraries by town**, so that I can see only the libraries in a specific area.

### Actors

- **User**: The primary actor who interacts with the website to browse library data.
- **Bristol Open Data API**: The external system providing the library data.

| **Use-Case ID** | **Use-Case Name**     | **Contributor** |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| **UC1**         | Browse Libraries      | Rishon          |
| **UC2**         | View Libraries on Map | M Z M Ajmal     |

#### **UC1: Browse Libraries**

| **Description**    | The goal is to display a list of libraries in a table format, providing details such as name, location, and services.                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actors**         | User                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Assumptions**    | User has access to a working internet connection and the website is functional.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Steps**          | 1. User opens the website.<br>2. User selects the "Browse Libraries" option.<br>3. The website queries the Bristol Open Data API for library data.<br>4. The website displays the retrieved data in a table format. |
| **Variations**     | - User can sort the table by columns such as name, location, or service.<br>- User can filter the table by location or services.                                                                                    |
| **Non-functional** | - The system must load the library data within 2 seconds.<br>- The table should be mobile-responsive.                                                                                                               |
| **Issues**         | - Ensure proper data validation before displaying the library information.                                                                                                                                          |

#### **UC2: View Libraries on Map**

| **Description**    | The goal is to display library locations on an interactive map for easier visualization of nearby libraries.                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actors**         | User                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Assumptions**    | User has access to a working internet connection and the website is functional.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Steps**          | 1. User opens the website.<br>2. User selects the "View Libraries on Map" option.<br>3. The website queries the Bristol Open Data API for library location data.<br>4. The website displays the libraries on an interactive map using markers. |
| **Variations**     | - User can click on a marker to view detailed library information.<br>- User can zoom and pan the map for better view.                                                                                                                         |
| **Non-functional** | - The map must load within 3 seconds.<br>- The map must be responsive to different screen sizes.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Issues**         | - Ensure proper error handling if the map data is incomplete or unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                   |
